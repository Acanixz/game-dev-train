# Contributing to game-dev-train

Thank you for considering contributing to the project!

We appreciate your interest in improving the codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines

### What We Accept
- **Code Improvements**: We welcome contributions that improve the code quality, adhere to best practices, and enhance maintainability.
- **Engine Upgrades**: Contributions that upgrade godot engine or dependencies to newer versions are accepted, provided they do not introduce breaking changes.

### What We Do Not Accept
- **New Features**: At this time, we are not accepting new features for completed games. However, you can check the [projects](https://github.com/Acanixz/game-dev-train/projects?query=is%3Aopen) or [issues](https://github.com/Acanixz/game-dev-train/issues) in the repository for new games that may need help with adding features.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository to work on your changes.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name for the branch (e.g., `improve-code-quality` or `upgrade-engine`).
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Run any available tests.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and the reasons for them.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Single Improvement per Pull Request**: Ensure that each pull request focuses on a single improvement. If you have multiple changes for different improvements, create separate branches for each change. This helps streamline the review process and makes it easier to understand and evaluate your contributions.

For example, avoid combining the following improvements in a single pull request:

    - Refactoring the player movement code for better readability.
    - Upgrading the Godot engine version.
    - Fixing a bug in the enemy AI behavior.
    - Adding new sound effects for game events.

Each of these improvements should be submitted as separate pull requests.

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project.
- Refer to the [GDScript Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) for detailed guidelines.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.

## Communication

- If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainers.
